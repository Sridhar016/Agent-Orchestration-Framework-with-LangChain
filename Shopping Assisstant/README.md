## ✨ Key Features

* **🤖 Conversational Shopping Assistant**: Get expert shopping guidance in a dedicated chat tab. Ask anything from "What's the best RAM for a gaming phone?" to "Suggest a gift for a teenager." Powered by a simple rule-based system or extensible with LLMs like **Gemini** or **OpenAI GPT**.
* **🔎 Interactive Product Finder**: Start with a broad query like "laptops" and narrow it down step-by-step with natural language commands like "Only Dell please," "under 40000," or "with 16GB RAM."
* **🧠 Smart Context & Memory**: The Product Finder is memory-aware. Each new constraint refines the *previous* search, creating a seamless and intuitive filtering experience, just like a real shopping dialogue.
* **✨ Modern & Responsive UI**: A clean, tabbed interface built with Streamlit, featuring a bottom-aligned input for a natural chat feel and a contrast-rich design for easy viewing.
* **🔌 Pluggable Architecture**: The system is powered by the **Fake Store API** for demonstration but is designed to easily connect to any real product database or e-commerce API.

## 🧠 How It Works: The Agentic Approach

This isn't just a simple chatbot. The application uses a multi-agent system where different Python agents collaborate to fulfill your request.

1.  **Coordinator Agent**: The "team lead." It receives your raw query and decides which specialist agent(s) to call.
2.  **Search Agent**: Handles initial product searches based on keywords (e.g., "smartphones," "men's clothing").
3.  **Price Agent**: Extracts and applies price or budget constraints from your query (e.g., "under 20000," "between 500 and 1000").
4.  **Review Agent**: Assesses and filters products based on ratings or review-related queries.
5.  **Memory**: A simple but effective memory system ensures that context is carried over between messages in the Product Finder.

This modular design makes the system easy to extend and maintain.
